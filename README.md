## Description
This is a job technical interview test for an Engineering Manager role at Welcome to the Jungle.

The project is a Phoenix-based app with a React-powered frontend.  
Follow the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section to run the project locally.

## Requirements
- Elixir 1.17.2-otp-27
- Erlang 27.0.1
- PostgresSQL
- Node.js 20.11.0
- Yarn

## Getting Started

### Setup Database
To run this project, you will need a PostgreSQL instance up and running.  
If you don't have one, you can create a local Docker container:

```bash
docker run \
    --name wttj_postgres_db \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=wttj_local \
    -d postgres
```

### Run Phoenix Server
To start your Phoenix server, you need to first set up the dependencies and run migrations:
```bash
  mix setup
```

then run the server
```bash
  mix phx.serve
```

if you don't want to run react you can do
```bash
   mix webapp
```
it will build react with latest source and put it directly in the right folder
Now you can visit `localhost:4000` in your browser.

### Run react app
Open a separate terminal window and navigate to the React app in the `/assets` folder:
```bash
  cd /assets
```
Install dependencies
```bash 
yarn
```

And finally run
```bash 
yarn dev
```

Now you can visit `localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Run Docker
You can also run the application directly using Docker.
Don't forget to do migration on the db first with `mix ecto.setup`

1. Build the Docker Image:
Set your environment variables:
`SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Choose your secret key.
`DATABASE_URL`: Example for a local database: `postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/wttj_local`
`PHX_HOST`: Example for local: 0.0.0.0

```bash
docker build -t wttj_docker_app . \
  --build-arg SECRET_KEY_BASE=#YOUR_SECRET_HERE# \
  --build-arg DATABASE_URL=#DATABASE_URL# \
  --build-arg PHX_HOST=#PHX_HOST
```
quick run for local purpose
```bash 
docker build -t wttj_docker_app . \    
   --build-arg SECRET_KEY_BASE=gqrNUYcQTT1euSJkcTf2iSKBwz9uhmnA5V2XyUoNPUVf2rB0AEbsfy6c0xXg//WA \
   --build-arg DATABASE_URL=postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/wttj_local \
   --build-arg PHX_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

2. And finally run it
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 wttj_docker_app
```

## Tests
- **Backend:** `mix test`
- **Frontend:** `cd assets && yarn test`

## Works

All requirements will be detailed in separate pull requests.

## Learning
I found this Fullstack test to be an incredibly relevant and engaging experience. It was exciting to work on a project that closely mirrors the actual challenges you're solving at your company. This alignment allowed me to gain valuable insights into your day-to-day work and the technologies you use.

The focus on a real-time candidate management system was particularly interesting as it's a feature commonly used in modern products. It showcased the complexities involved in creating intuitive, responsive interfaces for managing dynamic data.

I put significant effort into demonstrating how I approach and resolve product issues. Although the project is not 100% finished (e.g., I would have liked to integrate Cypress for testing), the MVVM pattern I adopted allowed me to test how the page reacts without additional tools. Every step was carefully chosen to strike a balance between perfection and the ability to iterate quickly.

### What I Plan to Do Next:
- Complete the column feature (significant improvement for user experience and further optimization opportunities).
- Add a workflow for production builds.
- Fine-tune session management (potential backend system integration).
- Implement enhanced error management.

While there's always room for improvement, I am proud of what I was able to achieve within the given timeframe. The projectâ€™s evolution from concept to implementation was rewarding, and it gave me tangible insights into the innovative solutions your company is creating.
